This Recsys brings the three major paradigms of recommender systems into one package. These three recommender systems are popularity modeling, content based filtering and collaborative filtering. Besides this it brings two custom-made  recommender systems: Hybrid and Composite.  Hybrid refers to content based filtering + collaborative filtering. Composite refers to popularity + content based filtering + collaborative filtering. The Recsys also uses online(incremental) learning concepts where the learning model is made to adapt to new environment changes in the database.  Ultimately the Recsys will have the incremental learning  concepts applied in all of its working though the current implementation lacks on some parts of it. This will be improved through time to don't prematurely optimize it.
